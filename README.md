# Love Riot ðŸ’˜ by Cupid&Co

## Intro

In the name of all things ***RoMaNcE*** this Valentine's February, The **Love Riot** web app showcases the **Love Compatibility Calculator**.
Based on zodiac star sign compatibility, users can calculate a potential compatibility score with their partner or crush and send the results on by email.

Compatibility scoring is displayed as a percentage match of the astrological star-signs of each person - adapted from [numerologysign.com](https://numerologysign.com/zodiac-signs-compatibility/)!

# Site Goals


## Problem Statement

When it comes to the complexities of love and relationships, many people 'look to the stars' in order to analyse the potential of a budding romance between two people. We decided to build our Valentine's themed application as a Love Compatibility Calculator which is both fun to use and shares some insights into the compatibility of the astrological star-signs.


## Objectives

In the spirit of Valentine's day, our objective was to create a functioning love compatibility calculator game which displays a percentage compatibility score after the user has input two names and two zodiac star-signs.

### Target Audience

The target audience of this game is anyone interested in learning about astrolgical star-sign compatibility in romantic relationships. It can also be played as a light hearted game for all ages, especially around Valentine's Day, where the results can be forwarded to friends (or a crush) by email.
