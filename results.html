              <strong>Virgo</strong> and <strong>Leo</strong> . Leo is generous
              with praise, even in public, while public praise makes Virgo very
              uncomfortable. Virgo tries to help others by offering constructive
              criticism and suggestions, which does not endear Leo’s sign in the
              least. This is especially true as Virgo can be rather stingy with
              praise. Sometimes, differences between signs can bring balance,
              but this is only when there are enough other commonalities between
              the signs.

              <strong>Virgo</strong> and <strong>Scorpio</strong> can make an
              incredible couple, exciting and full of energy, with an
              interesting sex life. However, if they give in to their individual
              darkness, this is a couple that can become pretty depressing for
              both of them, as well as those around them.

              they discover that their love is deep enough and their vision and
              the way to realize it, come together to create beauty.

              much as a control freak and a chaos addict, a healthy meal and a
